## About (pa03_a.py)
The Pima Indians Diabetes Database is a widely used dataset in machine learning, particularly for binary classification tasks related to diabetes prediction. The dataset consists of 768 instances. There are 8 numeric predictive attributes. The attributes are as follows:
 - Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
 - Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
 - BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
 - SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
 - Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
 - BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
 - DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
 - Age: Age in years

The target variable is a binary variable indicating whether a patient has diabetes or not. It takes the values 0 (no diabetes) or 1 (diabetes). Now your goal is to build a feed forward neural network from scratch to accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on the given attributes.

## About (pa03_b.ipynb)
The PneumoniaMNIST consists of 5,856 pediatric chest X-Ray images. The task is binary-class classification of pneumonia against normal. The #Training/ Validation/Test is 4,708/524/624. The source images are gray-scale, and their sizes are (384–2,916) × (127–2,713). Image size is 1 × 28 × 28.

The target variable is a binary variable indicating whether a patient has pneumonia or not. Now your goal is to build a feed forward neural network using tensorflow to accurately classify.

## Instructions
  - Make sure you have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
  - Please accept this invite (shared in the Google Classroom) for the GitHub Classroom.
  - Once you accept the assignment invitation, you will be redirected to your assignment repository on GitHub.
  - You're supposed to only change the sections where you are allowed to do so in the pa03_a.py script.
  - Then upload or commit and push the changes to your assignment repo.
  - Your assignment will be automatically graded, otherwise, you will receive an email that the auto-grading has failed then make sure the code has no errors.
